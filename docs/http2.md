`actix-web` automatically upgrades connections to *HTTP/2* if possible.

# Negotiation

<!-- TODO: use rustls example -->

When either of the `rustls` or `openssl` features are enabled, `HttpServer` provides the [bind_rustls][bindrustls] method and [bind_openssl][bindopenssl] methods, respectively.

<!-- DEPENDENCY -->

```toml
[dependencies]
actix-web = { version = "3", features = ["openssl"] }
openssl = { version = "0.10", features = ["v110"] }
```

<CodeBlock example="http2" file="main.rs" section="main" />

Upgrades to HTTP/2 described in [RFC 7540 ยง3.2][rfcsection32] are not supported. Starting HTTP/2 with prior knowledge is supported for both cleartext and TLS connections ([RFC 7540 ยง3.4][rfcsection34]) (when using the lower level `actix-http` service builders).

> Check out [the TLS examples][examples] for concrete example.
