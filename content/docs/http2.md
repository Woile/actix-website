`actix-web` automatically upgrades connections to _HTTP/2_ if possible.

# Negotiation

_HTTP/2_ protocol over TLS without prior knowledge requires [TLS ALPN][tlsalpn].

<!-- TODO: use rustls example -->

> Currently, only `rust-openssl` has support.

`alpn` negotiation requires enabling the feature. When enabled, `HttpServer` provides the [bind_openssl][bindopenssl] method.

```toml
[dependencies]
actix-web = { version = "{{< actix-version "actix-web" >}}", features = ["openssl"] }
openssl = { version = "0.10", features = ["v110"] }
```

{{< include-example example="http2" file="main.rs" section="main" >}}

Upgrades to _HTTP/2.0_ schema described in [rfc section 3.2][rfcsection32] is not supported. Starting _HTTP/2_ with prior knowledge is supported for both clear text connection and tls connection. [rfc section 3.4][rfcsection34].
